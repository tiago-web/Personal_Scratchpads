3 pretas (P,M,G)
2 off white (P,M)
1 camel (M)
1 mocha (M)


Now the system work in two different manners. One is to see the model clothes on a certain color. I would like the ability to select the part of the clothes I wanted to wear as well. So basically mantain the current logic were we can see either on the model woman on a certain color or on the user on a certain color. But also I would like the option to choose the part of the clothes. Example:
Flow:
1. User uploads a photo of themselves.
2. Select the clothe part: a biker jacket
3. Select the color for the biker jacket (out of a set of clothes parts we will have)
4. Select another clothe part for the bottom: a pants
5. Select the color of the pants.
6. Generate the image that will have an overlay in case they didnt input their contact info.
